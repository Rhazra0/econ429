## Data Sets Used

### For commodity to mandi mapping: 
(i.e. state_mandi_commodity_prices_2-13.csv) I utilized the "Current Daily Price of Various Commodities from Various Markets (Mandi)" from data.gov.in for Feb, 13, 2024. According to data.gov.in, "The data refers to prices of various commodities. It has the wholesale maximum price, minimum price and modal price on daily basis. This dataset is generated through the AGMARKNET Portal (http://agmarknet.gov.in), which disseminates daily market information of various commodities."

### For WDRA registered warehouses mapping per state:
I used the warehouses registered under the Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) whose registration date was 2018 (the earliest offered on the site). This contributes to my additional objective of comparing wheat prices pre-2018 and during 2018, given mandi distance to these warehouses.
